# Basic-HTML-Website
Basic HTML Website: This is a foundational HTML-only project designed to showcase essential web structure and semantic tags. Ideal for beginners to understand the basics of web development and create a simple, well-structured multiple-page layout.

Goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML i.e. different sections of a website like header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars etc. Do not style the website, only focus on the structure. Styling will be done in separate projects.

In this project, I was required to create a simple HTML only website with multiple pages. The website should have following pages:

- Homepage
- Projects
- Articles
- Contact

The website is to have a navigation bar that should be present on all pages and link to all the pages.

I was not required to style the website, only required to create the structure of the website using HTML. Goals of this project are:

- Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.
- Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.
- Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.
- Add SEO meta tags to the website.
